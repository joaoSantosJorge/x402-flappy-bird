# Firebase Database Schema

This document describes the structure of the Firestore database used in the Flappy Bird Prize Pool Competition application.

## Database Overview

The application uses **Google Cloud Firestore** to manage:
- Player scores and game sessions
- User profiles and statistics
- Prize pool cycles and metadata
- Payment and donation records
- Current cycle state

---

## Collections

### 1. `scores` (Current Cycle Only)

Stores active game scores for the current cycle. This collection is cleared and archived at the end of each cycle.

**Document ID:** `walletAddress` (user's wallet address in lowercase)

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `walletAddress` | string | User's Ethereum wallet address (lowercase) |
| `playerName` | string | User's display name (shortened wallet address format) |
| `score` | number | Highest score achieved in current game session |
| `timestamp` | timestamp | Server timestamp when the score was submitted |
| `ipAddress` | string | IP address of the submitter (for abuse detection) |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x1234567890abcdef...",

## Relationships

```
cycleState (current)
    ↓
    └─→ scores (current active scores)
    └─→ userProfiles (user stats across cycles)
         ↓
         └─→ cycleStats (stats per cycle)

End of Cycle:
    ↓
    scores → scores_DD-MM-YYYY_to_DD-MM-YYYY (archive)
    ↓
    metadata → cycleMetadata (add cycle record)
    ↓
    cycleState (reset with new dates)
```

---

## Data Flow

### During a Cycle
1. Users play games → scores recorded in `scores`
2. Users pay USDC → payment logged in `payments`
3. User stats updated in `userProfiles.cycleStats`
4. Prize pool grows in blockchain

### At Cycle End
1. `cycleManager` function executes
2. Allocate funds to top 3-7 winners via smart contract
3. Archive scores to `scores_DD-MM-YYYY_to_DD-MM-YYYY`
4. Save cycle metadata to `cycleMetadata`
5. Clear `scores` collection
6. Create new `cycleState` with next cycle dates

---

## Indexes Required

For optimal query performance, create these composite indexes:

### `scores` Collection
- `walletAddress` (Ascending)
- `score` (Descending)

### `cycleMetadata` Collection
- `createdAt` (Descending)

### `userProfiles` Collection
- `walletAddress` (Ascending)
- `lastActiveAt` (Descending)

### `payments` Collection
- `walletAddress` (Ascending)
- `timestamp` (Descending)

---

## Security Rules

The database should enforce these security rules:

- Users can only read their own profile
- Users can only write their own scores
- Admin functions (cycle operations) restricted to authenticated service account
- Donations can be read publicly (incentive)
- Payment history private to user

---

## Maintenance

### Cleanup
- Archive collections are preserved indefinitely for historical data
- `scores` collection automatically cleared each cycle
- Old `cycleState` documents can be archived if needed

### Backup
- Firestore automatically backs up data daily
- Manual backups should be taken before cycle transitions

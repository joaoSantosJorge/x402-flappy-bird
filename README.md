# Flappy Bird Competition Prize Pool

A blockchain-based competitive Flappy Bird game with USDC prize pools on Base Sepolia. Players pay to play, compete for high scores, and winners claim rewards through smart contracts.

## Overview

Each game cycle operates through a smart contract that handles micropayments and leaderboard management. Players pay **0.02 USDC for 20 attempts**, building a prize pool that is distributed to top performers at the end of each cycle.

### How It Works

1. **Payment**: Players connect their wallet and pay 0.02 USDC for 20 game attempts
2. **Competition**: Compete for high scores stored in Firebase Firestore
3. **Cycle End**: Backend function triggers end of competition cycle
4. **Distribution**: Smart contract allocates funds to top 1-10 winners based on rankings
5. **Claiming**: Winners have 7 days to claim rewards; unclaimed funds roll over to next cycle

## Features

### Current Features

- ✅ **Web3 Wallet Integration** - Connect with Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask
- ✅ **USDC Payments** - Pay-to-play with USDC on Base Sepolia
- ✅ **Prize Pool System** - Automated prize distribution via smart contract
- ✅ **Real-time Leaderboard** - Firebase Firestore integration
- ✅ **Retro UI Design** - Minimalist black/white theme with dark mode toggle
- ✅ **Anti-Cheat** - Address blocking functionality
- ✅ **Dynamic Play Cost** - Admin-configurable play cost with cross-tab sync
- ✅ **Configurable Tries Per Payment** - Admin-configurable tries granted per payment

### Smart Contract Controls (Owner Only)

- Set fee percentage
- Configure cycle duration
- Configure tries per payment
- Define winner allocation (1-10 winners with custom percentages)
- Block/unblock addresses
- Emergency functions

### Additional Capabilities

- Direct donations to prize pool (anyone can contribute)
- 7-day claim window with automatic rollover
- Complete transaction history tracking

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **Python 3** (for local development server)
- **Foundry** (for smart contract development)
- **Firebase CLI** (for backend deployment)
- **Git**
- **Web3 Wallet** (Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask)
- **Base Sepolia ETH** (for testing)

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd flappybird-pool-competition

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd functions && npm install && cd ..

# Start local development server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000/frontend/


# Firebase emulator (to test dev)
firebase serve --only hosting
```

### Firebase Functions (Backend)

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI globally
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Smart contract tests (Foundry)
forge test

# Backend tests (Node.js)
cd functions
npm test
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in appropriate directories:

**Root `.env` (for contract deployment)**:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
```

**`functions/.env` (for backend)**:
```env
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=path_to_service_account.json
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xdd0bbf48f85f5314c3754cd63103be927b55986c
```

See [docs/SECRET_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/SECRET_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md) for details.

## Smart Contract

### Deployed Contract (Base Sepolia)

- **Address**: `0xdd0bbf48f85f5314c3754cd63103be927b55986c`
- **Explorer**: [View on BaseScan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xdd0bbf48f85f5314c3754cd63103be927b55986c)
- **Network**: Base Sepolia Testnet
- **Owner**: 0x87B3Fb6381EdC7B9Ae89540B5764f2a75C36A31B

### Key Functions

- `allocateFunds(address[] winners, uint256[] percentages)` - Distribute prize pool
- `claimRewards()` - Winners claim their allocated rewards
- `blockAddress(address)` / `unblockAddress(address)` - Anti-cheat measures
- `setCycleDuration(uint256)` - Configure cycle length
- `setFeePercentage(uint256)` - Adjust platform fees

## Deployment

### Deployment Order

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: What you practice in dev, you will do in prod.

1. **Deploy Smart Contract**
   ```bash
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url base-sepolia --broadcast --verify
   ```

2. **Update Contract Address**
   - Edit `frontend/js/payments.js`
   - Set `flappyBirdContractAddress` to deployed contract address

3. **Deploy Database & Backend**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,functions
   ```

4. **Deploy Frontend**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```
